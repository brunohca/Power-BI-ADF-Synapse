# Learning Path

- Learning paths must be at least 3 modules and preferably no longer than 7. 
- Modules can be contained within multiple learning paths. 
- You may put other, already existing modules in your learning path.

Please fill out the below info to help us keep your learning path organized properly.

Learning Path Title:  
< TITLE >

Module Titles:  
- < TITLE >
- < TITLE >
- < TITLE >
- < TITLE >

## Instructions

Learning paths are defined by a single yaml file. Please fill out all commented fields in the example yaml file in this folder.

For each new module in your learning path, copy the module folder and do all content development there. Modules & their content do NOT live inside a learning path folder.

## Notes for partnership content

Learning path index page intro text will follow this format:
1.	Learning Path title includes partner name (“…inspired by <partner>” or “…in partnership with <partner>”). Note: if author attribution on index pages ships in H2, we will utilize this feature instead.
2.	Inline introduction video, as described in previous section, supported by the learning path intro videos/images feature 
3.	Connective-tissue text (**formatted as tip**): “This learning path is part of a multi-modal learning experience. Start the first module to see how you can follow along!”, as described in the previous section
4.	Intro text which introduces partnership, including partner-supplied copy and linking to partner website if required, and hints at technical topics covered
5.	Additional paragraph(s) to explain technical topics covered
6.	Bulleted list of Learning Path objectives (exists, required by Learn)
7.	Bulled list of Prerequisites (exists, required by Learn) 

Module index page intro text will follow the same format with these exceptions:
- Module title does NOT include partner name, unless relevant to module 
- Module index pages will not contain a video or image (platform constraint)
- Module index page text will briefly re-introduce the partnership, similar to Learning Path
- Connective-tissue text (**formatted as tip**): “This module is part of a multi-modal learning experience. Start the module to see how you can follow along!”
