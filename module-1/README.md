# Module

Please fill out the below info to help us keep your module organized properly.

Module Title:  
< TITLE >

Unit Titles:  
- Introduction
- < TITLE >
- < TITLE >
- Summary

## Instructions

All modules should have this folder structure:

- top level module folder
  - includes
    - 0-unitname.md
    - 1-unitname.md
    - 2-unitname.md
    - etc.md
  - media
    - yourimagefile.png
  - 0-unitname.yml
  - 1-unitname.yml
  - 2-unitname.yml
  - index.yml

In **each** .yml file, please fill out all commented fields to the best of your ability. If you have any questions, reach out to Shana.

## Knowledge checks

All modules are required to either have at least one knowledge check or at least one hands-on exercise unit that uses the sandbox in some way. Having both is better.

We recommend having at least one knowledge check, even if you do have hands-on exercises that use the sandbox. Knowledge checks are:

- Multiple choice (no True/False)
- Don't have "All/None of the above" as an option
- Should actually contribute to learning
- Need to have the correct answer indicated
- Need to have explanations for why each answer is either correct or incorrect

Knowledge checks can be embedded in a unit or exist as a standalone unit. 

- If embedded, knowledge checks should be 2-3 questions. 
- If standalone, they must be the second-to-last unit in a module and must be 3-5 questions. They should not be combined with the Summary unit, instead they should be their own unit right before. 

Knowledge checks live inline in a unit's .yml file. It can be tedious to put them in with the correct syntax so if you'd like, you can instead put them in the unit's .md file in a reasonable format and we will translate them. Standalone knowledge check units won't have (don't need) a .md file, but you can put a dummy .md file in as a placeholder to keep consistent.

## Notes for partnership content

Learning path index page intro text will follow this format:
1.	Learning Path title includes partner name (“…inspired by <partner>” or “…in partnership with <partner>”). Note: if author attribution on index pages ships in H2, we will utilize this feature instead.
2.	Inline introduction video, as described in previous section, supported by the learning path intro videos/images feature 
3.	Connective-tissue text (**formatted as tip**): “This learning path is part of a multi-modal learning experience. Start the first module to see how you can follow along!”, as described in the previous section
4.	Intro text which introduces partnership, including partner-supplied copy and linking to partner website if required, and hints at technical topics covered
5.	Additional paragraph(s) to explain technical topics covered
6.	Bulleted list of Learning Path objectives (exists, required by Learn)
7.	Bulled list of Prerequisites (exists, required by Learn) 

Module index page intro text will follow the same format with these exceptions:
- Module title does NOT include partner name, unless relevant to module 
- Module index pages will not contain a video or image (platform constraint)
- Module index page text will briefly re-introduce the partnership, similar to Learning Path
- Connective-tissue text (**formatted as tip**): “This module is part of a multi-modal learning experience. Start the module to see how you can follow along!”
